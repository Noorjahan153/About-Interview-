1> What is DHCP?
Ans: DHCP (Dynamic Host configuration Protocol)is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuratin parameters to devices in a network.
2> Explain the difference between TCP and UDP?
Ans: TCP(Transmission control protocol)is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures data reliability,while UDP(User Datagram protocol)is connectionless and focuses on faster data transmission without guaranteed delivery.
3> What is Raid?
Ans:Raid(Redundant array of Indenpendent Disks)is a technology that combines multiple hard drives to improve data performance,redundancy,or both.
4> How do you secure a server?
Ans: Server security involves implementing firewalls,regular security updates,access controls,intrusion detection systems,and strong authentication methods.
5> What is virtualization?
Ans: virtualization is the process of creating virtual instances of hardware,operating systems,storage,or networks on a single physical machine.
6> Explain the role of a DNS serve.
Ans: DNS(Domain Name System)servers translate humanreadable domain names into IP addresses,facilitating the browsing of websites and services.
7> How do you troubleshoot network connectivity issues?
Ans: Troubleshooting network issues involves checking physical connections,verifying ip configurations, using 
8> What is the purpose of an SSL Certificate?
Ans: An SSL(Secure sockets layer)certificate encrypts data transmitted between a user's browser and a server,ensuring secure communication.
9> Describe a backup strategy you'd implement?
Ans: A solid backup strategy includes regular automated backups,off-site storage,versioning,and periodic recovery testing.
10> What is the role of firewall?
Ans: A firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules,protecting a network from unauthorised access.
11> How would you handle a server outage during business hours?
Ans: Rapid Response is crucial.Notify relevant parties,invetigate the issues's root cause,and work on a solution while minimizing downtime.
12> Explain the concept of load balancing?
Ans: Load balancing distributes netwoork traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization,improve performance,and enhance redundancy.
13> What is the importance of patches and updates?
Ans: patches and updates fix security vulnerabilities,improve functionality,and enhance system stability,reducing the risk of security breaches.
14> How do you manage user accounts and permissions?
Ans: User management involves creating,modifying,and removing user accounts,as well as assigning appropriate permissions to ensure proper access controls.
15> Describe a disaster recovery plan?
Ans: A disaster recovery plan outlines procedures for data and system recovery after major disruptions,including steps for backup
